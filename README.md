# HexRPG

A revolutionary Minecraft RPG plugin brainstormed, developed and ran by the community of Minecraft.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of HexRPG up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run a build of HexRPG yourself

* [Java Development Kit 8](https://www.oracle.com/nl/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) - The JDK development environment for building applications
* An IDE which allows programming in Java
* An installation of Git on your local machine

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that will tell you how to get a development environment running

First, open up your command prompt and navigate (using the `cd` command) to a folder where you would like clone the repository to
Example:
```
cd "C:\IntelliJ-projects\"
```

Then, run the `git clone` command using this repository to download all necessary files for the source code of HexRPG, by doing so:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nosaiii/hexrpg HexRPG
```

Now open up your IDE, load the project by navigating to the folder you just created and enjoy coding!

## Contributing

Since HexRPG is open-source and freely accessible using Git, you are able to contribute to the project.

By creating your own branch from whatever other branch you like, you can start coding your own bits and parts in. After you have done that and you are satisfied with what you have made, you can open a pull request, which is the "approval" stage before merging your code in the develop branch (in which all new code is being put in before deployment). Code owners of this repository will review your code and put comments when necessarry if any changes need to be made before merging. The moment your pull request has been approved, it will be merged and your code is ready for deployment into the official HexRPG plugin.

There are a few requirements when deciding to contribute to the project. These requirements are as followed:
* Branch names will have a fully-lowercased name, words split by dashes, with a prefix, split by a slash, that defines what sort of branch it is
  * New implementation or changes of the code = `feature` (`feature/quest-npc`)
  * Any sort of bug/error fixes = `fix`
  * Git-related file moves, renames, etc = `change`

You will be put as a contributor here on GitHub and on the resource page on SpigotMC for contributing to the development of HexRPG.

Thakn you for contributing!
